Hi, this 2D RPG is based on teachings one can view by RyiSnow video tutorial on youtube (How-to make a 2D Game in Java): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq .
The series of RyiSnow include basics in understanding, how to display images on a GameScreen (JPanel), loading a world map with tiles (sprites as PNG-Images), collision detection wiht player and world objects, hints to make sounds, hints for ptfalls in game development 
and so much more. 
It's basic to step first to his video tutorials before checking out this project. 
The intention on this project is to create a 2D game in 2d-RPG style, adapting techniques attempt by RyiSnow teachings and to change the way instance variables (like as for collision detection) are invoked by more object-oriented way. 
Also, everyone is free to use the way how Tile-Map loading is done by the WorldMapTileManager class i did (based on RyiSnows idea with fixed world size, but which can be used more dynamically with WorldMapTileManager).
At the end i would like to thank RyiSnow for his teachings, effort and time to provide us with very good basics in game development, in many kinds of old school game styles (like Point&Click, Text-based adventure games..someone remembers text-based adventure game 
Atlantis' on a 368 PC?).
By honoring RyiSnow, i'll hope, he'll keep up the good work and maybe this branch could help someone to organize game dev in another way too.
So, the main goal is that at the end i could provide a 2d-GameEngine with aspects of a tile-world-map loader, generalized collision detection, and so on which is needed to build a 2d-Java game (there is so much more, like differnet camera functions/views).

2D Game-Development is a big fun, designing the images, characters and it's inspiring the human imagination/fantasy. That's the reason why the retro-games still exist and are played by so much people (even in days where massive 3D-OpenWorld games exist).

I think it's this essence, why most of us stick to 2D-GameDev (even in the Indie-Sector).....human imagination!

Cheers,
